# Findings about the engine (written by the game's developer)
One entry per finding, newest last. Be exact: what you did, what you expected, what happened, how to reproduce it in a few lines (a script, a command, an MCP call), and how much it hurt.

## The Lua HUD cannot be seen through the documented tools
kind: missing        severity: hurts
what I tried: a level with `on_hud` drawing text and a bar; MCP `screenshot`, and `voxelith --headless --manual --script idle:200 --frames 200 --screenshot out.png` with `--hud 1`, `--hud 0 --ui`.
expected: CLAUDE.md says "look at your work: screenshot after every visible change"; a game's HUD (health, announcer text, inventory) is half of what the player sees, docs/HUD.md says "Not in MCP and headless runs (no picture)".
happened: the headless / MCP picture never contains `on_hud` drawing (`--hud 1` draws the debug text, `--ui` the tool panels, never the script's `ui.*`). A developer without a display has no way to look at the HUD.
repro: projects/dungeon_crawler/level.lua at commit "plan": `function on_hud() ui.text(600, 40, "HELLO", {size=40}) end`, run the headless command above: no "HELLO".
workaround: `Xvfb :95 &`, `DISPLAY=:95 voxelith --windowed --manual --project P --time 0.75 --script idle:900 &`, wait 9 s, `ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1280x720 -i :95 -frames:v 1 out.png` (works, 13 fps with the GPU under Xvfb). Wrote tools/hudshot.sh for it. A `--screenshot` that includes the Lua HUD in headless mode (or an MCP `screenshot {hud: true}`) would fix it.

## docs/GUIDE.md names tools/xdrive.py, the package does not contain it
kind: unclear docs        severity: annoying
what I tried: "Testing the window without a screen: `Xvfb :95 &` then ... `DISPLAY=:95 tools/xdrive.py key e 0.3 key F5 0.3`".
happened: `tools/` has only voxelith_client.py, make_prefabs.py, make_creatures.py. There is no xdotool / libXtst on the machine either, so a windowed session can be looked at (ffmpeg x11grab) but not driven with keys or the mouse.
repro: `ls tools`.
workaround: HUD actions are plain global Lua functions that the tests call through the MCP `lua` tool.

## A headless CLI run writes the project's save file; the MCP server does not
kind: unclear docs        severity: annoying
what I tried: `voxelith --headless --manual --project projects/dungeon_crawler --script idle:200 --screenshot x.png` for a HUD test on a project with `save = world.vxs`.
happened: "saved 92 edited chunks to .../world.vxs" at exit, so the next start has `project.first_run() == false` and my level does not build. (MCP says it does not read or write the save unless `--save`; the CLI quietly does.) Easy to lose a morning to.
workaround: `rm projects/dungeon_crawler/world.vxs*` before every first-run test (the `.gen` folder next to it is a directory: `rm -rf`).

## `--dump-materials` writes `materials.csv` into the current directory
kind: unclear docs        severity: annoying
what I tried: `./voxelith --dump-materials` to read the built-in table (docs say "writes the table and prints where").
happened: it wrote `./materials.csv` in the repository root (the message names the path, but after the fact); easy to commit by accident. Only 24 built-in materials, `lantern` is only in the Lantern Cove's own table.

## No way to set the time of day (or fog / sky / ambient) from a project or from Lua
kind: missing        severity: hurts
what I tried: a dark dungeon carved into stone under a flat plain, 8 m under the surface.
expected: a closed stone room is dark, lit by torches.
happened: in the default daylight phase the whole closed room is lit blue-grey (sky ambient reaches probes under 7 m of stone); at night (`--time 0.75`, or the MCP screenshot's `time_of_day`) it is correctly black with the torch glow. The phase can only be given on the command line (`--time`) or per screenshot; the game cannot pick it, and no Lua / project.cfg key exists for the clock, the fog density or the ambient floor (only per biome with `terrain = biomes`).
repro: MCP `lua "edit.clear(1900,120,1900,2200,220,2200); player.teleport(128,7.6,128)"`, `screenshot` (blue room) vs `screenshot {time_of_day: 0.75}` (black).
workaround: the launcher script passes `--time 0.75`; `.mcp.json` too.

## Torch light needs about five seconds to show
kind: unclear docs        severity: annoying
what I tried: `emitter.create{name="t", preset="torch", pos=...}` and a screenshot 30 ticks later: a dim dot. After 330 more ticks the wall and floor are warmly lit.
expected: a light that is on is visible at once, or the docs say how long the GI needs (`gi_budget`).
happened: probes converge over several seconds; the preset's light is weak (reach?) until I gave `light = {color = {1, .55, .2}, reach = 14, flicker = true}`.
